# Clinic Outcomes Dashboard

The Clinic Outcomes Dashboard is an Angular-based web application designed to visualize clinical glucose metrics such as *Time in Range (TIR)* and *Glucose Management Indicator (GMI)*.  
It provides data-driven insights using interactive D3.js and Charts.js charts and a responsive SCSS-based layout suitable for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Project Purpose

This application was developed to present summarized clinical outcomes in a visual and comprehensible format.  
It allows healthcare teams to review patient glucose performance trends across different time ranges (30, 60, 90 days), enhancing decision-making and patient monitoring efficiency.

The dashboard focuses on two key metrics:
- **Time in Range (TIR):** Percentage of glucose readings within optimal range.
- **Glucose Management Indicator (GMI):** Estimated A1C derived from mean glucose levels.

The system emphasizes clean data visualization, performance, and usability across devices.
